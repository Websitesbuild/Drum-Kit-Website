# Drum-Kit-Website
Welcome to the Drum Kit Website repository! This project showcases a dynamic and interactive drum kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal of this project is to provide a fun and engaging way for users to play virtual drums either by clicking on the drum elements displayed on the screen or by using their keyboard.
